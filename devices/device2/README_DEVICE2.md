# Device 2 (WARP2PLC)

This folder is currently a placeholder. There is no Device 2 backend code checked into this repo yet (only documentation).

If you are looking for a working backend + UI, use:
- Device 3 backend: `devices/device3`
- Recommended UI: `ui/warp-console`

When the Device 2 backend is added, this README should be updated with:
- Run instructions (manual + systemd)
- Config path/format
- API endpoints and ports (expected: 8002)
